To run the code yourself:

    run `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
    change parameters to your liking in config.py, 
    then run `python multiprocessed_simulation.py`,
    data set will be saved in /output/data and logs in /output/logs
    to obtain figures run `python results.py`, figures will be saved in /output/figures. (out of date, using local jupyter notebook at the moment)
